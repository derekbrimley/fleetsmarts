		the sole and exclusive party that is responsible and/or liable to pay
		CONTRACTOR for its services. CONTRACTOR hereby waives
		any claim it may have, whether at law or in equity, against any
		person or entity other than against CARRIER for payment for its
		services and agrees that CONTRACTOR shall not, under any
		circumstance, seek payment from any shipper/consignor,
		consignee, or any other person or entity other than CARRIER for
		CONTRACTOR's services. CONTRACTOR shall not be entitled
		to claim any lien against any freight for freight charges or for any
		other reason; and, CONTRACTOR, for itself and any of its
		employees or agents, hereby waives and disclaims any lien rights
		that the same may otherwise have against any freight transported
		hereunder. If any other person or entity asserts a lien against any
		freight tendered hereunder, CONTRACTOR shall immediately
		take any steps necessary to remove and discharge any such
		asserted lien claim.<br><br>
		4.12 Prohibition Against Passengers, Pets and
		Guests.<br><br>
		CONTRACTOR acknowledges and agrees that it will
		not allow passengers, pets or guests to ride in the Equipment
		which under dispatch from CARRIER, unless and only to the
		extent that prior written authorization has been given by
		CARRIER. This prohibition does not include or apply to teams
		or co-drivers.
		5. Insurance<br><br>
		5.1 Auto Liability Insurance to be Provided by
		CARRIER.
		<br><br>Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 13906, it is the legal
		obligation of CARRIER to and CARRIER will procure and
		maintain insurance in proper amounts pursuant to FMCSA
		regulations for protection of the public from bodily injury, death
		or damage to property resulting from the negligent operation,
		maintenance, or use of the Equipment when such Equipment is
		being used in performance of transportation services for
		CARRIER while such Equipment is "under dispatch" by
		CARRIER pursuant to this Agreement. It shall be
		CONTRACTOR's responsibility, however, to pay to CARRIER
		and to reimburse CARRIER for CONTRACTOR's proportionate
		share of the cost of such automobile liability insurance.
		5.2 "Bobtail," "Deadhead," "Non-Trucking"
		Insurance. CONTRACTOR agrees to procure, carry and maintain
		insurance for the protection of the public from bodily injury,
		death or damage to property resulting from the negligent
		operation, maintenance, or use of the Equipment when such
		Equipment is NOT "under dispatch" and being used in
		performance of transportation services for CARRIER pursuant to
		this Agreement, including, but not limited to, "bobtail,"
		"deadhead," and/or "Non-Trucking" insurance coverage in
		amounts not less than may be required by the U.S. DOT, FMCSA
		or any applicable state or local governing entity or in such greater
		amount as CARRIER may require from time-to-time.
		CONTRACTOR agrees to furnish CARRIER evidence of such
		insurance coverage through valid certificates of insurance or
		otherwise and agrees that CARRIER shall be named and listed as
		an "additional insured" under such policy(ies). Upon request,
		CONTRACTOR shall provide a copy of any such insurance
		policy to CARRIER. Should CONTRACTOR fail to obtain the
		insurance required by this Section, CARRIER may obtain such
		insurance in CONTRACTOR's behalf and charge the costs of the
		same to CONTRACTOR and/or deduct such amounts from
		compensation to be paid to CONTRACTOR pursuant hereto.
		Regardless of the existence of insurance under this Section,
		CONTRACTOR shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
		CARRIER from and against any and all claims, demands, injuries,
		and causes of action arising out of or relating to operation of the
		Equipment when not under dispatch and being used in the
		performance of transportation services for CARRIER pursuant to
		this Agreement.<br><br>
		5.3 Cargo Loss and Damage Insurance.<br><br>
		CARRIER
		will procure and maintain cargo loss and damage insurance with
		limits of $100,000 per occurrence or in such other amount as
		CARRIER deems just and proper. It shall be CONTRACTOR's
		responsibility, however, to pay to CARRIER and to reimburse
		CARRIER for CONTRACTOR's proportionate share of the cost
		of such cargo loss and damage insurance. If CONTRACTOR is
		able to obtain its own cargo loss and damage insurance according
		to these established specifications and provide a certificate to the
		CARRIER, then CARRIER's responsibility to procure and
		maintain cargo loss and damage insurance shall be waved.
		5.4 Worker's Compensation Insurance.
		CONTRACTOR's relationship to CARRIER is that of an
		independent contractor. Accordingly, CONTRACTOR will
		provide workers' compensation insurance in amounts required by
		law and employer's liability insurance in the amount of at least
		$100,000 as the case may be covering CONTRACTOR and any
		and all of its employees, drivers, driver's helpers or others used by
		CONTRACTOR in performance of the services contemplated by
		this Agreement. CARRIER shall be listed as an "additional
		insured" under such workers' compensation policy(ies). If
		CONTRACTOR is a sole proprietorship, partnership, or other form
		of entity whose only employees are principals and are exempt from
		the legal requirement to carry workers' compensation insurance,
		CONTRACTOR will nevertheless either: a) procure workers'
		compensation insurance coverage anyway; or, b) obtain a Utah
		Statutory Employee Exclusion Insurance Policy and will have each
		such principal/employee sign a Utah Statutory Employee
		Exclusion Endorsement and will provide copies of the same to
		CARRIER and will procure and maintain occupational accident
		insurance covering any persons exempt from the requirement to be
		covered by workers' compensation insurance. CARRIER agrees to
		procure and maintain workers' compensation insurance on all of its
		employees, which does not include CONTRACTOR.<br><br>
		5.5 Physical Damage Insurance Coverage on
		Equipment.<br><br>
		CONTRACTOR agrees that in no event shall
		CARRIER be liable to CONTRACTOR for any loss, theft, or
		physical damage to the Equipment, unless such damage shall be
		caused solely by the negligent acts or omissions of CARRIER. If
		CONTRACTOR chooses to insure the Equipment against any
		loss, theft, or physical damage to the Equipment,
		CONTRACTOR shall procure, carry and maintain the same at
		CONTRACTOR's sole cost and expense.<br><br>
		5.6 Insurance Obtained through CARRIER.<br><br>
		If
		CONTRACTOR purchases any insurance coverage for the
		Equipment or relating to operation of the Equipment from or
		through CARRIER, CARRIER will provide to CONTRACTOR a
		certificate of insurance with respect to such policy(ies) of
		insurance obtained and, upon request by CONTRACTOR,
		CARRIER will also provide a copy of each such policy obtained to
		CONTRACTOR. Each such certificate of insurance provided with
		respect to any such policy(ies) shall include: a) the name of the
		insurer; b) the policy number; c) the effective dates of the policy;<br><br>
		d) the amounts and types of coverage provided by such policy(ies);
		and, e) the deductible amount applicable to each type of coverage
		provided for which the CONTRACTOR may be liable. CARRIER
		shall also provide in writing to CONTRACTOR (through the
		certificate of insurance, if possible and practicable) the costs to be
		assessed to CONTRACTOR for each type of insurance coverage
		obtained from or through CARRIER.<br><br>
		5.7 Required Endorsements/Policies/Cancellation or
		Expiration of CONTRACTOR's Insurance, Exclusions,
		Deductibles.<br><br>
		Immediately upon execution of this Agreement,
		CONTRACTOR shall cause CARRIER (and any other party that
		CARRIER specifically requests) to be listed as an "additional
		insured" under each of CONTRACTOR's insurance policies
		required to be procured hereunder through endorsements to such
		policies and will cause its insurance company to send copies of
		such endorsements and certificates of insurance confirming such
		listing to CARRIER via facsimile and U.S. mail. Such insurance
		policies shall also provide that they shall not be canceled, expire,
		terminate, or not be renewed, except upon the giving of thirty (30)
		days prior written notice to CARRIER. Upon request,
		CONTRACTOR will provide (or cause its insurance company or
		insurance agent to provide) CARRIER with true and correct copies
		of the insurance policies to be procured and maintained pursuant
		hereto, together with all required and applicable exclusions and
		endorsements. CONTRACTOR hereby warrants and represents
		that its insurance, as represented by certificates of insurance
		presented to CARRIER, is valid and continues in effect and that
		such policies of insurance have no exclusions or waivers that are
		inconsistent with providing the insurance coverage set forth herein
		or that would otherwise impair CARRIER from recovering for
		CONTRACTOR's liabilities hereunder. CONTRACTOR warrants
		that no deductible amounts under any of the insurance policies to
		be provided hereunder exceed $1,000.00. Neither
		CONTRACTOR's failure to procure or maintain the insurance
		required hereunder or any exclusions or conditions contained in
		any policies of insurance shall relieve or exonerate
		CONTRACTOR from any of its liability or obligations hereunder,
		nor shall CONTRACTOR be relieved of any liability or obligation
		hereunder because a claim or obligation exceeds the amount of
		insurance procured or maintained by CONTRACTOR. Should
		CONTRACTOR fail to provide adequate proof of the existence of
		the insurance required hereunder, CARRIER retains the right to
		immediately terminate this Agreement and the transportation of
		any load tendered to CONTRACTOR hereunder or to procure such
		insurance as may be required to be provided by CONTRACTOR
		hereunder and to receive reimbursement from CONTRACTOR for
		the cost of any such insurance procured, including seeking
		reimbursement from deducting such amount from any
		compensation to be paid to CONTRACTOR hereunder.<br><br>
		6. Cargo Loss and Damage Claims, Delay Claims,
		Accident Claims.<br><br>
		6.1 Cargo Loss and Damage Claims.<br><br>
		CONTRACTOR
		hereby assumes liability for and shall defend, indemnify, and hold
		harmless CARRIER from any and all loss, theft, shortage or
		damage caused to any freight tendered to or to be hauled by
		CONTRACTOR hereunder while such freight is in transit or is
		otherwise in CONTRACTOR's care, custody, or control
		(hereinafter "Cargo Claim"). CONTRACTOR acknowledges and
		agrees that its liability to CARRIER for any Cargo Claim shall be
		no less than that of a "common carrier" as provided for in 49
		U.S.C. § 14706 (the Carmack Amendment). In the event of a
		Cargo Claim, CONTRACTOR shall not dispose of damaged
		freight or freight rejected by a consignee without the prior written
		consent of CARRIER and/or the beneficial owner of such freight.
		6.2 Delay Claims. CONTRACTOR further assumes
		liability for and agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless
		CARRIER from any and all claims for delay in delivery of freight
		("a Delay Claim").<br><br>
		6.3 Notification of Cargo Claims and Delay Claims.<br><br> 
		In
		the event that a shipment tendered to or hauled by
		CONTRACTOR hereunder, or any part or portion thereof, is lost,
		damaged, or is otherwise not delivered in the same condition as
		when tendered to or delivered to CONTRACTOR or is refused by
		the consignee, or in the event that a shipment is not delivered to
		the appointed destination at the appointed time, CONTRACTOR
		shall immediately notify CARRIER. CONTRACTOR
		acknowledges and agrees that CARRIER shall retain the right to
		defend, settle, compromise, adjust, or otherwise resolve any Cargo
		Claim and/or Delay Claim as CARRIER deems appropriate in its
		sole and absolute discretion. CONTRACTOR's liability to
		CARRIER for any Cargo Claim or Delay Claim shall be in the
		same amount that CARRIER may be liable to pay or as CARRIER
		may otherwise determine, in its sole discretion, to pay to the
		shipper, consignee, beneficial owner, or other claimant regarding
		such Cargo Claim or Delay Claim. CONTRACTOR shall also be
		liable to CARRIER for and will pay to CARRIER all
		administrative expenses and costs incurred by CARRIER in
		connection with the investigation, defense, adjustment, settlement
		and/or resolution of any Cargo Claim or Delay Claim (hereinafter
		"Adjusting Costs"), plus the freight charges allocable to the freight
		that is the subject of such a Cargo Claim or Delay Claim.<br><br> 
		6.4 CONTRACTOR's Reporting of and
		Indemnification for Accident Claims.<br><br> 
		In the event that
		CONTRACTOR's driver or the Equipment that is transporting a
		load tendered hereunder is involved in an accident or other incident
		causing or involving personal and/or bodily injury or death to any
		person (including, but not limited to, members of the public as a
		whole, CONTRACTOR or any of CONTRACTOR's employees or
		agents), involving damage to the property of another person
		(including, but not limited to, environmental contaminations or
		other damage to the environment or damage to the facilities of the
		shipper or the consignee)--all such types of claims being referred
		to hereafter as "Accident Claims", CONTRACTOR shall
		immediately notify CARRIER of any such occurrence or accident
		and will provide all necessary information and documentation of
		the same to allow CARRIER to investigate the same and report the
		same to the proper FMCSA, U.S. DOT, or other state or local
		authorities. CONTRACTOR further agrees to indemnify, defend,
		and hold harmless CARRIER and any of CARRIER's officers,
		directors, shareholders, employees and agents from and against any
		and all such Accident Claims, whether such Accident Claims arise
		out of or occur during the course of transporting, loading,
		unloading, staging, or otherwise moving such load, or otherwise
		while such load is in the possession, care, custody or control of
		CONTRACTOR or while CONTRACTOR is traveling to or from
		a pick- up location or a delivery destination, except that
		CONTRACTOR shall not be obligated to indemnify CARRIER or
		any other party to be indemnified by CONTRACTOR or
		CONTRACTOR's insurer hereunder to the extent that any such
		Accident Claim(s) is caused in whole or in part by the negligence,
		intentional acts or omissions of CARRIER or such other party to
		be indemnified hereunder; provided, however, that
		CONTRACTOR shall nonetheless still be required to defend,
		indemnify and hold harmless CARRIER and any other party to be
		indemnified hereunder for any and all Accident Claims arising out
		of the negligence, intentional acts, omissions, or other fault of
		CONTRACTOR or any of its agents, employees, or
		subcontractors. Any person or entity to be indemnified from
		Accident Claims hereunder shall have the right, but not the
		obligation, to participate in the defense, negotiation, and/or
		settlement of any such Accident Claims, either on its own or
		through attorneys of its own choosing, without relieving
		CONTRACTOR of any of its obligations hereunder.<br><br> 
		6.5 Damage to and Return of CARRIER's Equipment.<br><br> 
		Any and all semi-trailers and/or other equipment that may be
		furnished to CONTRACTOR by CARRIER to facilitate and/or in
		connection with CONTRACTOR's performance of its
		responsibilities hereunder shall be and remain the exclusive
		property of CARRIER. CARRIER shall be entitled to immediate
		possession of any such semi-trailers, including any freight or
		lading thereon, or other equipment, as well as all shipping
		documents, bills of lading, fuel cards, credit cards, keys, plates,
		permits, stickers, or other materials furnished by CARRIER, upon
		termination of this Agreement or upon the request or demand of
		CARRIER at any time and CONTRACTOR agrees to return the
		same to any location specified by CARRIER at CONTRACTOR's
		sole cost and expense. If any semi-trailer and/or other equipment
		is not immediately returned by CONTRACTOR as CARRIER
		shall instruct, CONTRACTOR shall be liable to CARRIER for
		any costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees,
		incurred by CARRIER in returning the same, plus $100.00 per
		day until such semi-trailer or equipment is properly returned to
		CARRIER. CONTRACTOR shall be liable to CARRIER for any
		theft, loss, damage or destruction of any of CARRIER's
		equipment or property occurring while such equipment or
		property is in CONTRACTOR's possession, custody, use or
		control or that is otherwise damage by the acts or omissions of
		CONTRACTOR, reasonable wear and tear excepted (hereinafter
		"Equipment Damage Claims").<br><br> 
		6.6 Charge-Backs for Cargo Claims, Delay Claims,
		Accident Claims, and Equipment Damage Claims.<br><br> 
		CARRIER shall
		be entitled to and CONTRACTOR hereby agrees and authorizes
		CARRIER to charge-back, offset and/or deduct from any amounts
		to be paid to CONTRACTOR as compensation hereunder the
		amount of all Cargo Claims, Delay Claims, Accident Claims,
		and/or Equipment Damage Claims or a reasonable estimate of the
		amount thereof, as well as the Adjusting Costs associated with the
		same and the freight charges allocable to any freight that is the
		subject of any such Cargo Claim(s) and/or Delay Claim(s). In the
		event of such charge-backs or deductions, CARRIER shall provide
		a written explanation and itemization of any deductions for Cargo
		Claims, Delay Claims, Accident Claims and/or Equipment
		Damage Claims to CONTRACTOR prior to such deductions being
		made.<br><br> 
		7. Independent Contractor Relationship/No Delegation.<br><br> 
		7.1 Independent Relationship.<br><br> 
		CONTRACTOR's
		relationship to CARRIER shall at all times be that of an
		independent contractor and nothing contained herein shall be
		construed to be inconsistent with that status. No term or provision
		of this Agreement, nor any act or omission of either party shall be
		construed for any purpose to express or imply any joint venture,
		partnership, principal/agent, master/servant, fiduciary,
		employer/employee or other relationship between
		CONTRACTOR AND CARRIER, other than that of an
		independent contractor relationship. No employees or other
		agents of CONTRACTOR shall be construed under any
		circumstance to be the employees, servants, or agents of
		CARRIER, CARRIER's customer, the shipper/consignor, the
		consignee, or any "bill to" party. CONTRACTOR shall have no
		authority to act on behalf of CARRIER or to alter in any manner
		any contractual or other relationship of CARRIER with its
		customers, shippers/consignors, consignees, or any other person
		or entity. CONTRACTOR shall bear all costs of and shall provide
		all labor, wages, payroll, equipment, fuel, maintenance,
		insurance, federal, state and local payroll taxes and any other
		taxes, unemployment insurance, pensions, social security
		payments, workers' compensation insurance, and all other costs
		associated with transportation of freight pursuant to this
		Agreement and the performance of CONTRACTOR's services
		hereunder. CARRIER shall not be liable for any such costs and
		CONTRACTOR agrees to indemnify, defend and hold CARRIER
		harmless from any and all claims or liability imposed or asserted
		against CARRIER relating to such costs.<br><br> 
		7.2 No Control or Right of Control by
		CARRIER.<br><br> 
		CARRIER cannot and shall not exercise any control
		over the manner in which CONTRACTOR performs its services
		hereunder or CONTRACTOR's operations, nor does CARRIER
		retain any right to control or otherwise supervise CONTRACTOR
		or CONTRACTOR's employees or other agents. CONTRACTOR
		shall be solely responsible for any and all management, control,
		governance, discipline, of its employees, agents, owner/operators,
		and equipment. Even though CARRIER or its customers,
		shippers/consignors, consignees, or other persons or entities may
		from time-to-time in Load Confirmations or other documents
		provided to CONTRACTOR by CARRIER or CARRIER's
		customer, or other verbal or written instructions suggest routes,
		types of equipment, methods of securing loads, methods of loading
		or unloading freight or other means of transporting and delivering
		the subject freight, such suggestions, if given, are for informational
		purposes only. CONTRACTOR retains the right to choose routes,
		times that CONTRACTOR will perform its services, employees,
		equipment to be used, methods of securing loads, methods of
		loading or unloading freight and all other means of transporting
		and delivering the freight. CONTRACTOR agrees, however, that it
		shall deliver each load tendered to it by CARRIER hereunder to its
		appointed destination in good condition and in a timely manner
		according to the dates and times that each such load should be
		picked-up and delivered and that CONTRACTOR will do so in a
		safe and lawful manner and in accordance with all laws pertaining
		to hours of service and other laws and regulations, including, but
		not limited to, those relating to safety. CONTRACTOR should
		consider instructions, guidelines and/or other suggestions from
		shippers/consignors and/or consignees; CONTRACTOR, however,
		remains ultimately responsible to choose and control the method of
		loading, unloading, and securing the load and transporting the load
		and will do so in a manner that the same may be loaded,
		transported, and unloaded safely without damaging the load or
		endangering the public or any person or entity.<br><br> 
		7.3 Delegation/Subcontracting/Brokering
		Prohibited.<br><br> 
		CONTRACTOR shall not broker, subcontract, assign,
		interline or otherwise transfer or delegate the transportation of
		any load offered or tendered to it by CARRIER hereunder to
		another carrier, person or entity, nor shall CONTRACTOR retain
		or engage any subhaulers, connecting carriers, rail carriers or
		other mode of transportation, nor shall CONTRACTOR
		otherwise delegate any of its duties hereunder, without the prior
		written consent of CARRIER with respect to any and each
		specific load so delegated. In the event that CONTRACTOR
		breaches this provision prohibiting brokering subcontracting,
		assigning, interlining or otherwise delegating any of
		CONTRACTOR's duties hereunder, CONTRACTOR agrees to
		indemnify, defend, and hold harmless CARRIER for any claims
		or actions arising out of or relating to the acts or omissions of the
		person or entity to whom CONTRACTOR brokered,
		subcontracted, assigned, interlined, transferred the load or
		otherwise delegated its duties with respect to such load and this
		Agreement, whether such claims or actions involve damage to
		freight or other property or involve personal or bodily injury,
		including death, caused to any person. In addition, CARRIER
		retains the right, at CARRIER's sole option, to not pay
		CONTRACTOR for transportation of such a load.
		8. CONTRACTOR's Representations and Warranties.<br><br> 
		CONTRACTOR hereby warrants and represents to CARRIER
		that: a) CONTRACTOR shall at all times operate its business in a
		safe and prudent manner and in strict and full compliance with all
		state, federal, and local statutes, rules, and regulations relating
		pertaining to the transportation services to be provided pursuant
		hereto, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to safety,
		including, but not limited to, safety of operations, 49 C.F.R. Part
		391 pertaining to qualification of drivers; 49 C.F.R. Part 392
		pertaining to driving of motor vehicles; 49 C.F.R. Part 393
		pertaining to parts and accessories necessary for safe operation;
		49 C.F.R. Part 395 pertaining to hours of service for drivers; 49
		C.F.R. Part 396 pertaining to inspection and maintenance of
		equipment; 49 C.F.R. Part 397 pertaining to transportation of
		hazardous materials, driving and parking rules, all federal, state
		and local laws pertaining to weight, height, width, length and/or
		other dimensional restrictions, and transportation of Hazardous
		Materials, as defined in 49 C.F.R. § 172.800, § 173 and § 397, et
		seq. ("HAZMAT"), including the licensing and training of
		HAZMAT qualified drivers to the extent that any loads of freight
		tendered hereunder constitute HAZMAT, security regulations,
		loading and securement of freight, controlled substance and
		alcohol use testing, sanitation, temperature, and contamination
		requirements for transporting foods, perishables or other products,
		all other insurance and workers' compensation requirements, etc.,
		b) any and all equipment that CONTRACTOR will use to
		transport a load tendered hereunder is safe, has been properly
		maintained in a manner that it would pass any and all federal,
		state, or local safety inspections, and that it is properly fit and
		designed to be used for the particular type of load that is to be
		hauled; c) CONTRACTOR will properly train its drivers in
		connection with the safe loading, transporting, and unloading of
		freight tendered hereunder and will abide by all safety rules,
		regulations, and policies of shippers and consignees to whom
		freight tendered hereunder is delivered, including, but not limited
		to, the safety rules, regulations, and policies of job sites to which
		freight tendered hereunder may be delivered; d) CONTRACTOR
		will not supply equipment that has been used to transport
		hazardous wastes, solid or liquid, regardless of whether they meet
		the definition contained in 40 C.F.R. § 261.1 et seq.; e)
		CONTRACTOR, by its signature, acknowledges that it has
		carefully read and understands each of the provisions hereof and
		agrees to the same and that CONTRACTOR has had adequate
		opportunity to engage and receive advise and counsel from legal,
		accounting, and/or other advisors of CONTRACTOR's own
		choosing in connection with entering into this Agreement; and, f)
		CONTRACTOR will not haul any freight with the Equipment
		during the term of this Agreement, except as is authorized and
		tendered to CONTRACTOR by CARRIER pursuant hereto.
		9. Non-Soliciting/Confidentiality:<br><br> 
		9.1 Covent to Not Solicit.<br><br> 
		CONTRACTOR
		recognizes that CARRIER has spent substantial time, money and
		resources developing business relationships with its customers
		and is providing a valuable service to CONTRACTOR under this
		Agreement in offering the transportation of freight and tendering
		of freight to CONTRACTOR to be hauled. Therefore, as part of
		the consideration for this Agreement, CONTRACTOR agrees
		that, during the term of this Agreement (including any extensions
		hereof) and for a period of twenty-four (24) months following
		termination of this Agreement, CONTRACTOR will not solicit
		freight from or otherwise perform transportation or freight broker
		services, either directly or indirectly, for any customer of
		CARRIER for which CARRIER, whether through
		CONTRACTOR, other contractors, carriers, or otherwise, has
		hauled freight generating revenue to CARRIER of at least
		$20,000 in any one-year period either prior to or during the time
		that this Agreement is in effect (hereinafter "CARRIER's
		Customers"), except as is required by CONTRACTOR to fulfill
		its obligations under this Agreement. Should CONTRACTOR
		violate the non-solicitation provisions of this Section 9,
		CONTRACTOR agrees to pay CARRIER, as liquidated
		damages, an amount equal to thirty-percent (30%) of the gross
		transportation revenue generated by CONTRACTOR's
		performing transportation or brokerage services for any of
		CARRIER's customers for a period of twenty-four (24) months
		following termination of this Agreement. Should it be shown
		that CONTRACTOR hauled freight for a specific customer of
		CARRIER resulting in freight charges in an amount exceeding
		an aggregate of $20,000 paid to CONTRACTOR during the
		one-year period immediately prior to the date of this Agreement
		or the date that CONTRACTOR first hauled a load tendered to
		it by CARRIER (whichever is earlier), such customer of
		CARRIER will be exempt from the non-solicitation provisions
		of this Agreement.<br><br> 
		9.2 Confidential Information.<br><br> 
		CONTRACTOR further agrees that
		it shall protect and keep confidential any and all non- public,
		confidential, or proprietary information of CARRIER, including,
		but not limited to, the identity of customers, customer lists, freight
		and brokerage rates, pricing, freight volume requirements, and/or
		any information disclosed or provided to CONTRACTOR
		pursuant to 49 C.F.R. § 376.12(g) or other law ("Confidential
		Information"), that might be provided to CONTRACTOR in
		connection with performing this Agreement or otherwise and that
		CONTRACTOR shall not disclose the same, without the prior
		written approval of CARRIER.
		9.3 CONTRACTOR's Employees/Agents. CONTRACTOR
		covenants and agrees that it will require each and every of its
		employees or other agents to sign agreements containing the
		provisions set forth in Sections 9.1 and 9.2 hereof pursuant to
		which CONTRACTOR's employees and agents agree not to
		solicit freight or perform transportation or brokerage services for
		any of CARRIER's customers for a period of twenty-four (24)
		months following termination of such employee or agents
		employment, contractual or other relationship with
		CONTRACTOR and pursuant to which CONTRACTOR's
		employees and agents agree to not disclose CARRIER's
		Confidential Information. Such agreements shall be in the form of
		those agreements attached hereto or in such other form as
		CARRIER shall specify.<br><br> 
		10. Additional Remedies/Injunctive Relief.<br><br> 
		In addition to
		damages and any other remedies afforded to CARRIER by law or
		in equity, all provisions of this Agreement may be specifically
		enforced; provided, however, that the failure of CARRIER to
		promptly enforce such provisions shall not be construed to be a
		waiver of CARRIER's rights hereunder. In addition,
		CONTRACTOR recognizes that the payment of damages
		hereunder may not fully compensate CARRIER for
		CONTRACTOR's breach of the provisions of this Agreement and
		that CARRIER will likely suffer irreparable harm from such a
		breach. Accordingly, CONTRACTOR agrees that should it
		breach, violate, or threaten to breach or violate the provisions of
		this Agreement, that CARRIER will be entitled to injunctive relief
		prohibiting CONTRACTOR's breach, violation or continued
		breach or violation without the need of CARRIER having to post
		any bond in connection with such injunctive relief.
		11. Records of Equipment. CARRIER shall prepare, keep,
		maintain and preserve, as part of its transportation records,
		documents pertaining to the Equipment and each trip for which the
		Equipment is used containing the following information: I) the
		name and address of CONTRACTOR; ii) the point of origin and
		final destination of each load hauled; iii) the time and date of
		departure of each load hauled; iv) information identifying the
		cargo/lading being hauled; and, v) indicating that transportation of
		the same is CARRIER's responsibility. While the Equipment is
		hauling freight, the above information pertaining to each load shall
		be kept with the Equipment. Thereafter, such records shall be
		preserved at CARRIER's place of business.<br><br> 
		12. CONTRACTOR Not Required to Purchase or Rent
		from CARRIER.<br><br> 
		CONTRACTOR is not and shall not be
		required to purchase or rent any products, equipment, or services
		from CARRIER as a condition of entering into this Agreement or
		continuation of the same. Should CONTRACTOR be a party to
		any agreement pursuant to which CONTRACTOR is a party to
		any equipment or other purchase arrangement with CARRIER or
		should CONTRACTOR be a party to a lease, rental or other
		agreement through which CONTRACTOR is purchasing,
		leasing, renting or otherwise acquiring any product, equipment or
		service from CARRIER for which CARRIER is authorized to
		make deductions from the compensation to be paid to
		CONTRACTOR hereunder, such agreement shall be attached
		hereto as an Addendum or the terms of which will be described
		in an Addendum hereto.<br><br> 
		13. Fuel Use Tax Payments/IFTA.<br><br> 
		CONTRACTOR may
		elect to maintain its own IFTA account for fuel taxes. If
		CONTRACTOR elects to maintain its own IFTA account,
		CONTRACTOR will provide CARRIER with a copy of all fuel tax
		documentation within thirty (30) days after the filing date. If
		CONTRACTOR elects not to maintain its own IFTA account,
		CARRIER will assume responsibility for timely filing fuel use tax
		returns with the Base State in which the Equipment is registered.
		CONTRACTOR will submit timely reports on forms supplied by
		CARRIER and will furnish documentation for all miles driven and
		fuel on a state-by-state basis, which will typically be accomplished
		automatically through fuel card statements and logs or satellite
		tracking records. CARRIER will file the necessary reports with the
		various taxing jurisdictions. If monies are owed to a particular state
		for CONTRACTOR's miles in that state, CARRIER will pay the
		same. If a state owes a refund or if a credit is allowed based upon
		miles traveled and fuel purchased by CONTRACTOR in a
		particular state, CARRIER is entitled to and may retain or utilize
		any such refund or credit.<br><br> 
		14. Copies of Agreement on the Equipment.<br><br> 
		The original
		and two (2) copies of this Agreement shall be signed by the
		parties hereto. CARRIER shall retain the signed original of this
		Agreement at its regular place of business. Unless a statement
		prepared by CARRIER or its authorized representative certifying
		that an item of the Equipment is: a) being operated by CARRIER;
		b) specifying CONTRACTOR's name; c) the date and length of
		the lease term; d) any restrictions relative to commodities that
		may be transported pursuant hereto; and, e) the address at which
		the original lease is kept by CARRIER, then a signed copy of this
		Agreement will be placed in each item of the Equipment.
		CONTRACTOR shall also retain a signed copy of this
		Agreement.
		15. Miscellaneous.<br><br> 
		15.1 Governing Law/Jurisdiction/Attorney Fees.<br><br> 
		This Agreement
		shall be deemed to have been negotiated and entered into within
		the State of Utah. Accordingly, except to the extent (if any) that
		they are preempted by federal law, the laws of the State of Utah
		shall govern the construction and interpretation of this Agreement.
		CONTRACTOR expressly submits to the jurisdiction of the Courts
		of the State of Utah and the United States District Court for the
		District of Utah and agrees that jurisdiction and venue shall be
		proper in such Courts and Carrier waives any claim or defense that
		such Courts will be an inconvenient forum. CONTRACTOR
		agrees to pay to CARRIER any and all costs and attorney fees
		incurred by CARRIER in enforcing any term or provision of this
		Agreement, whether incurred before or after institution of a formal
		legal proceeding and whether incurred before or after entry of a
		judgment.<br><br> 
		15.2 Other Miscellaneous Provisions.<br><br> 
		This Agreement and any
		Addenda hereto constitute the entire agreement between the parties
		hereto and are intended to be a complete integration of terms. This
		Agreement and any Addenda hereto replaces and supercedes any
		and all prior agreements between the parties. No other prior or
		contemporaneous agreements exist between CARRIER and
		CONTRACTOR, except as are set forth herein or as otherwise
		expressly incorporated by reference. No termination or expiration
		of this Agreement shall relieve either party from any obligation
		that was incurred hereunder prior to the effective date of such
		termination or expiration; and, this Agreement shall inure to the
		benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, successors
		or assigns. The person executing this Agreement on behalf of
		CONTRACTOR warrants and represents that he/she has valid,
		existing actual authority to execute the same on behalf of
		CONTRACTOR and agrees to personally indemnify CARRIER
		from any breach of this warranty of authority. If any term or
		provision hereof is held invalid or unenforceable by a court or
		tribunal of competent jurisdiction, such term or provision shall be
		deemed to be modified to be enforceable or, alternatively, shall be
		deemed to be severed here from, and shall not affect the remaining
		provisions hereof, which shall remain enforceable to the full extent
		allowed by law. This Agreement shall be deemed to have been
		prepared by both CONTRACTOR and CARRIER; thus, any rule
		of law or construction that any ambiguities contained herein shall
		be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this Agreement.
		The failure of either party to enforce a breach or waiver of any
		provision or term of this Agreement shall not be deemed to
		constitute a waiver of any subsequent failure or breach. The terms
		of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
		any successors and, to the extent allowed hereunder, to the assigns
		of the assigns of the respective parties hereto. Any paragraph
		and/or section headings contained herein are for convenience only
		and shall not affect the interpretation or construction of this
		Agreement. Time is of the essence of this Agreement. This
		Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each
		of which will be deemed to be a duplicate original hereof.
